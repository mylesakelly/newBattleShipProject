Battle Ship Game - README

This is a Battle Ship game played in the console. This game was created entirely with Java. This game involves the user trying to locate the three ships placed on the gameboard and sinking them by guessing their correct coordinates. This game is played against the computer and the goal is to sink all the ships with the fewest number of guesses.

How to Play

Setting Up the Game:

Fork this repository and run the code in IntelliJ. Once the game is run, You will be given instructions asking you to guess the coordinates of "The Osiel", "The Justin", and "The Ivan"!
You must sink all three ships to win.


Gameplay:

You will be prompted to enter your guess for a ship's location using the format "letternumber" (e.g., "a0," "b3," etc.).
The game will respond with "miss," "hit," or "kill" based on your guess's outcome.
"miss" indicates that your guess did not hit any ship.
"hit" indicates that your guess hit a ship but did not sink it.
"kill" indicates that your guess hit a ship and sank it.


Winning:

Your goal is to sink all three ships in the fewest number of guesses possible. The game will continue until all ships are sunk.

Ending the Game:

The game ends when you have successfully sunk all three ships. At that point, the game will display your performance:

If you managed to sink all ships in 18 or fewer guesses, you'll be congratulated for winning!
If it took you more than 18 guesses, you'll receive a lighthearted comment about your performance. Have fun!
